# Tomato Disease Classifier

The Tomato Disease Classifier is a Python-based application that uses deep learning to classify diseases in tomato plants. It helps identify specific diseases affecting tomato crops, enabling targeted treatments and preventive measures.

## Features

- Classifies the following tomato diseases:
    1. Bacterial spot
    2. Early blight
    3. Late blight
    4. Leaf mold
    5. Septoria leaf spot
    6. Spider mites
    7. Target spot
    8. Tomato yellow leaf curl virus
- Uses a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) model for accurate disease classification.
- Provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for easy interaction.
- Allows users to select an image of a tomato plant for disease classification.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:


git clone https://github.com/your-username/tomato-disease-classifier.git


2. Install the required dependencies:


pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage

1. Run the application:


python predict.py


2. Select an image of a tomato plant using the graphical user interface.
3. View the predicted disease on the console.

## Model Training

If you're interested in training the model yourself, you can follow these steps:

1. Collect and prepare a dataset of tomato plant images labeled with corresponding disease classes.
2. Split the dataset into training and validation sets.
3. Train the CNN model using the `train.py` script.
4. Save the trained model as "tomato_model.h5".
